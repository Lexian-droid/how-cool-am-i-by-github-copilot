# How Cool am I
### By Github Copilot
### Idea by Lexian-Droid (TimeWisely)

# What is this project?
This is the first project I made with the help of Github Copilot. It was able to understand roughly **90%** of what I was telling it to do, and It also was able to infer much of what I was saying with proper context.

It only failed to do so a few times, and it did get stuck every so often, but I was able to fit it by just being a bit more clear.

# What does it do?
The index file included contains a basic HTML structure generated with VS Code, but the content inside of <body> was done with Github Copilot. 
I was able to make it create a few headers, classes, all of that. I also took advantage of W3.CSS, which made Github Copilot also infer the existence of W3.CSS, it was able to understand that they can be used for color and font sizes, and all!
  
The Javascript included is simply generating a value from 0 to 100, which is fun because believe it or not, but I don't actually know javascript! So Copilot really did just make my life easy. I'm sure this'll help me in the future, because I can just tell it what to do! But anyways,
  
  It just generates a value from 0 to 100, and then prints it into the document, replacing the string with ID "Coolness" (it came up with it automatically*) and I decided to tell it to change the value based on the size of the number, it was a bit confused, but I was able to fix it by editing the command.
  
  # What is the point of this?
  The point of this Github Repository is to show you guys and gals how well Github Copilot actually is, I thought it was gimmicky, the videos, i thought they were just fabricated, and this entire document was thrown together in just about 30 minutes simply by telling a little robot friend to do a bunch of different things!
  
  Really cool!
  
  # Conclusion
  So, enjoy this little test. Don't get offended over it, it's nothing serious. It's simply generating a random number, it's Github, you can read the code if you need it.
  
 Thank you, enjoy!
